title: What is escrow?
---

Escrow is a legal arrangement in which a third party temporarily holds assets until the terms of an agreement have been met.

This provides a level of safety and security for both parties without the risk of one side running away.

In the case of Smart Invoice, this “third party” is a smart contract. 

The contractor promises to fulfill a specific service and only gets paid once the service is delivered according to the terms of the agreement.

The client funds the escrow so the contractor can begin work, and once that work is completed, the client can release those funds from the escrow into the contractor's wallet.
