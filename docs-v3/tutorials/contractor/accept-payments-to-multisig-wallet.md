title: How to accept payments to your multisig wallet
---

We currently recommend using Gnosis Safe if you choose to use a multisig wallet. Gnosis Safe is intuitive to use, serves all the major networks, and has a solid track record as a secure multisig option.

Receiving payments on a multisig is the same receiving funds on any other wallet.

**However!**

It is difficult to get the same multisig wallet address on different chains. Therefore be aware if you set your client address to a multisig that is on a different chain than your invoice. It is not assured you will be able to reproduce that address on the invoiceâ€™s chain. 

**You must confirm that the your multisig address is on the same chain as the invoice before you create the invoice.**
