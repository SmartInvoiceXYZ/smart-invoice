title: How to request milestone payments be released from escrow
---

After you’ve completed the work associated with a milestone, you can request funds be released from escrow.

This is a manual process, and you will need to notify your client.

Your client will log into their Smart Invoice account with the wallet linked to the invoice, and navigate to the invoice. They will click a blue button labeled “Release” and create the transaction to deliver the milestone payment from the escrow to your wallet address.
