title: How to request a deposit to escrow from your client
---

Once you have configured your invoice and are ready for the client to fund the initial milestone payment through escrow, you will need to manually notify your client.

The client can log into smartinvoice.xyz with the wallet address you linked to the invoice during the invoice creation process. From there, they will be able to see the invoice you created and they can follow the instructions here in the documentation to fund the first milestone.

The other option is to navigate to the invoice details page inside of Smart Invoice (by following the instructions here), and then copying the url to this page from your browser and sending it to your client. Then your client will be able to log into Smart Invoice and click the “Deposit” button inside of your invoice.
