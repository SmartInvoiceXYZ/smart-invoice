From this modal you will detail your arbitration decision and divide the disputed amount according to your decision.

You are paid 5% of the disputed amount for your arbitration services. Therefore the client and provider awards together will add up to 95% of the disputed amount.

Click Resolve when you have completed all fields and sign the prompted transaction from your wallet provider. The funds will be distributed to both parties according to your decision.

Thoroughly double check your decision and award amounts before clicking Resolve. After the transaction is signed there is no way to modify the decision.
