title: How to lock a milestone and request arbitration if there is a dispute
---

Once your wallet is connected to Smart Invoice, click the “Dashboard” link at the top of the page.

This will display a list of all of your invoices.

Click on an invoice in the list to open it.

Here you can view all the details relevant to your invoice, and the specific actions you can perform. 

If there are any milestones that you have funded via escrow, but have not yet released to your contractor’s wallet address, you can click the “lock” button.

This will display a prompt where you can enter the details of your dispute. These details will be sent to the arbitrator you selected during the invoice creation process.

Click the “Lock” button to begin the arbitration process.

Now your arbitrator will see the details of your dispute inside of their Smart Invoice account, and can determine who to release funds to. 

It is essential that you contact your chosen arbitrator manually (email, text, DM, etc) to notify them about the dispute. Then they can log into Smart Invoice to manage this dispute.

***Note: Smart Invoice does not notify the arbitrator about the dispute. They will see it in their Smart Invoice account, but you need to notify them to log into their account.***
