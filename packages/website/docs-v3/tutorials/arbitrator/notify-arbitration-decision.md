title: How to notify the contractor and client of arbitration decision
---

Both client and provider will see the results of your decision on the invoice page.

After the resolution transaction is confirmed, the invoice page will list the total amount disbursed, your arbitration fee, and the awarded amounts to client and provider.  

**View details on IPFS:** Your written decision is stored on IPFS and viewable by all parties from this link.

**View transaction:** From this link, all parties can view the resolution transaction on the networkâ€™s block explorer.

Currently there is no notification of the decision to the client and provider outside of the platform, although this is a projected future feature. You will need to message them directly.
