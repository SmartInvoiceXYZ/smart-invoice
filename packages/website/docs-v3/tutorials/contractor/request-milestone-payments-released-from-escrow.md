title: How to request milestone payments be released from escrow
---

After you’ve completed the work associated with a milestone, you can request funds be released from escrow.

This is a manual process, and you will need to notify your client.

Then your client can log into their Smart Invoice account with the wallet linked to the invoice, and navigate to the invoice. They will see a blue button labeled “Release” and can get the milestone payments delivered to your wallet address.
