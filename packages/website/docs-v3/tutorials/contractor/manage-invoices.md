To open an invoice, you can click on the invoice in the list, or you can click the 3 dots next to your invoice in the “Action” column and click “Manage”.

This will bring up your invoice.

Here you can view all the details relevant to your invoice, and the specific actions you can perform. 

As a contractor you can add milestones, download a PDF of the invoice, and lock the invoice.
