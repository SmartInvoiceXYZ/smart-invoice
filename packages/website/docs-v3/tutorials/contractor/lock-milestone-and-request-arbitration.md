---

Navigate to the invoice you want to lock.

If there are any milestones that have been funded via escrow, but payments have not yet been released to your wallet address, you can click the “lock” button.

This will display a prompt where you can enter the details of your dispute. These details will be sent to the arbitrator you selected during the invoice creation process.

Click the “Lock” button to begin the arbitration process.

Now your arbitrator will see the details of your dispute inside of their Smart Invoice account, and can determine who to release funds to. 

It is essential that you contact your chosen arbitrator manually (email, text, DM, etc) to notify them about the dispute. Then they can log into Smart Invoice to manage this dispute.

Note: Smart Invoice does not notify the arbitrator about the dispute. They will see it in their Smart Invoice account, but you need to notify them to log into their account.
