title: How do I log in?

Smart Invoice is a web3 application, which means you don’t actually create an account with an email address like you would with credit card invoicing tools. 

So there is no traditional “log in” process.

To use Smart Invoice, you simply connect your cryptocurrency wallet to the site and you are logged in. Super easy and safe. 

If the prompt doesn't automatically appear, click the "Create Invoice" button to trigger it.
