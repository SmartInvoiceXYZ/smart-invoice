title: What is "locking" and arbitration?

### What is "locking"?

If there is a dispute, you or your client can click a button to “lock” funds held by that invoice. This lock triggers the arbitration provider (Kleros, or the custom arbitrator you chose) to review and resolve the dispute. 

If the client loses confidence in the contractor at any time, or the contractor under delivers on their promise, the client may lock any remaining funds in Smart Invoice so they cannot be released or withdrawn.

Alternatively, if the client has not released funds after a milestone is complete, the contractor may lock any remaining funds in Smart Invoice.



### What is arbitration?

Arbitration is triggered by either the client or contractor locking funds held by their smart invoice. 

Arbitration is the process of resolving a dispute between a client and a contractor, and it is facilitated by a third-party adjudicator.

Based on the arbitrator’s review, they will determine who should receive funds and will send a transaction to Smart Invoice that transfers those funds to the contractor or the client. 

Our recommended arbitrator, Kleros, currently charges a 5% fee that is automatically deducted from the funded milestone for their arbitration services.
