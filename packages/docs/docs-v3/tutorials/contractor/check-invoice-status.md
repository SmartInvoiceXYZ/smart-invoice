Once your wallet is connected to Smart Invoice, click the “Dashboard” link at the top of the page.

This will display a list of all of your invoices.

Next to each invoice you will see the status of that invoice.

**Possible statuses included:**

- Awaiting Deposit (the client needs to fund the escrow)
- Funded (escrow has been funded and you can begin work)
- Completed (all milestone payments have been released from escrow)
- Expired (the invoice has passed the Safety Valve Date and the client can retrieve funds in escrow)
- In dispute (escrow has been locked and disputed funds will be released by the arbitrator)
- Dispute Resolved (disputed funds have been released by the arbitrator)
