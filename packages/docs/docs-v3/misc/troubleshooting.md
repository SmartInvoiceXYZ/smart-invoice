### Why are incorrect dates / times showing up on the PDF invoice?

If you see an incorrect date, it’s possible it is in a format you are not used to. Smart Invoice is based in the USA and uses the standard American Month/Day/Year format.

All times use GMT and will not reflect your local timezone.


### Why don’t I see the token I need in the invoice creation list?

If you don’t see a supported token listed in the drop down menu, you may be connected to the wrong Network. 

Check your wallet to ensure you are connected to the proper network for your preferred token, and then refresh your browser. 

This will reset your invoice to the beginning and you will need to start over, but you should see your preferred token in the drop down menu now.


### Why don’t I see any of my invoices?

If you don’t see any of your invoices after you’ve connected your correct wallet to Smart Invoice, your invoices may be stored on the legacy version of Smart Invoice.

Smart Invoice was rebooted September 7, 2022 and if you used the tool before this date, you will need to visit legacy.smartinvoice.xyz and reconnect your wallet to your old invoices.
